    "### Training Configuration and Environment Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "This section establishes the foundation for the deep learning experiment. It imports necessary libraries, defines the experimental scope (dataset and features), sets up the file system for results, and initializes critical hyperparameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Library Imports\n",
    "The script leverages **TensorFlow/Keras** for building the deep learning architecture. Notably, it imports a diverse set of layers—`Conv2D` (CNN), `LSTM` (RNN), and `MultiHeadAttention`—confirming the **hybrid** nature of the model.\n",
    "* **Evaluation:** `sklearn` metrics are imported to calculate Precision, Recall, and F1-score.\n",
    "* **Explainability:** `shap` is imported for feature importance analysis.\n",
    "* **Visualization:** `matplotlib` is set up for plotting training history and interpretation heatmaps.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Experiment Configuration\n",
    "The script uses constant flags to control the specific experimental setup. By modifying variables like `DATASET` (e.g., `MPOWER_DATASET`) or `MODE`, the user can switch between different training scenarios without altering the core logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Dynamic Path Management\n",
    "To ensure a structured workflow, the code dynamically constructs file paths based on the selected configuration:\n",
    "* **Input Path:** Points to the `.npz` feature file generated by the preprocessing pipeline.\n",
    "* **Output Paths:** Automatically creates directories to separate model checkpoints (`best_model.keras`), evaluation logs, SHAP analysis values, and Grad-CAM heatmaps. This ensures that results from different experiments do not overwrite each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Hyperparameters & Optimization\n",
    "Key training parameters are defined here to control the model's learning process:\n",
    "* **Epochs (30) & Batch Size (32):** Standard settings for convergence on this dataset size.\n",
    "* **Learning Rate (0.001):** A standard starting point for the Adam optimizer.\n",
    "* **Regularization:**\n",
    "    * **Dropout (0.5):** A high dropout rate is used to aggressively prevent overfitting, which is critical for medical datasets with limited samples.\n",
    "    * **L2 Regularization (0.01):** Applied to penalize large weights and further improve generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Model Checkpointing\n",
    "A `ModelCheckpoint` callback is initialized to monitor the **Validation AUC** (`val_auc`).\n",
    "* **Strategy:** It saves the model weights *only* when the AUC improves.\n",
    "* **Rationale:** In medical diagnostics, where class imbalance is common, maximizing AUC is often more clinically relevant than maximizing simple accuracy."

    "### Model Architecture: ParkinsonDetectorModel\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ParkinsonDetectorModel` is a custom Keras model designed for the binary classification of Parkinson's Disease using spectral audio features. It employs a **hybrid architecture** that sequentially extracts spatial features using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and then processes these features in parallel using Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTMs) and Multi-Head Attention mechanisms.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Class Structure and Initialization\n",
    "The class inherits from `tensorflow.keras.models.Model` and is decorated with `@register_keras_serializable()`, ensuring the custom model structure can be saved and loaded correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Components in `__init__`:**\n",
    "* **Input Reshaping:** A `Reshape` layer adds a channel dimension (depth=1) to the 2D input (Mel Spectrograms + MFCCs) to make it compatible with 2D Convolution.\n",
    "* **CNN Blocks:**\n",
    "    * Two consecutive blocks of `Conv2D` layers (64 filters, 5x5 kernel) followed by `MaxPooling2D` and `Dropout`.\n",
    "    * These layers are responsible for learning spatial hierarchies and local patterns in the time-frequency domain.\n",
    "    * L2 regularization (`kernel_regularizer=l2`) is applied to all convolutional layers to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "* **Parallel Branches:**\n",
    "    * **Attention:** A `MultiHeadAttention` layer (2 heads) to identify and weigh critical segments of the feature sequence.\n",
    "    * **LSTM:** A dual-layer `LSTM` stack (128 units) to capture temporal dependencies and long-term evolution of the signal.\n",
    "* **Fusion & Output:**\n",
    "    * `Concatenate` layer to merge the outputs from the CNN, Attention, and LSTM streams.\n",
    "    * A Dense `bottleneck` layer (128 units) for feature compression.\n",
    "    * A final `Dense` output layer with a **Sigmoid** activation for binary probability (Healthy vs. Parkinson's).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Forward Pass Logic (`call` method)\n",
    "The `call` method defines the data flow through the network:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Feature Extraction (Sequential):**\n",
    "    * The input passes through the two CNN blocks.\n",
    "    * The output `x` (after the second pooling) represents the high-level spatial features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Branching:**\n",
    "    * **Branch 1 (Spatial):** The CNN output `x` is flattened (`cnn_flat`) to preserve spatial feature information.\n",
    "    * **Sequence Preparation:** The CNN output `x` is reshaped into a sequence format `(batch, time_steps, features)` to serve as input for the temporal branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Parallel Processing:**\n",
    "    * **Branch 2 (Attention):** The prepared sequence is passed through Self-Attention (`query=key=value=sequence`). The result highlights important time steps.\n",
    "    * **Branch 3 (Temporal):** The same sequence passes through the LSTM layers to model temporal dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Fusion and Classification:**\n",
    "    * The outputs of all three branches (`cnn_flat`, `att_flat`, `lstm_out`) are concatenated into a single rich feature vector.\n",
    "    * This vector passes through the bottleneck layer and finally the output layer to produce the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Serialization Support\n",
    "The model includes `get_config` and `from_config` methods. These are essential for saving the model's architecture and custom hyperparameters (like `input_shape`) to disk and reconstructing it later without recompiling the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Builder Function\n",
    "The `build_model(input_shape)` helper function wraps this custom class instantiation within the Keras Functional API paradigm. This is standard practice to ensure the model is built and the input shape is correctly inferred before training begins."

    "### Feature Extraction for Dimensionality Reduction Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This module is designed to extract high-dimensional feature vectors from the internal layers of the trained model. Specifically, it targets the point where features from the CNN, LSTM, and Attention branches are concatenated, just before they enter the final dense classification layers. These extracted vectors are essential for visualizing the model's learned representation space using techniques like PCA, t-SNE, or LDA.\n",

    "#### Class: `DenseLayerInputExtractor`\n",
    "\n",
    "This class handles the creation of a sub-model that isolates the intermediate output of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Initialization (`__init__`)**\n",
    "The constructor initializes the class and immediately calls `_setup_extraction_model` to prepare the internal Keras model for feature extraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Model Setup (`_setup_extraction_model`)**\n",
    "This is the core logic that reconstructs the forward pass of the model up to the concatenation layer.\n",
    "* **Layer Identification:** It iterates through the trained model's layers to find the specific `ParkinsonDetectorModel` instance.\n",
    "* **Graph Reconstruction:** It re-defines the flow of tensors through the specific branches:\n",
    "    * **CNN Branch:** Passes input through convolutional and pooling layers to extract spatial features (`cnn_flat`).\n",
    "    * **Sequence Reshaping:** Reshapes the CNN output to be compatible with sequence processing.\n",
    "    * **Attention Branch:** Computes self-attention on the sequence (`att_flat`).\n",
    "    * **LSTM Branch:** Processes the sequence through LSTM layers to capture temporal dynamics (`lstm_out`).\n",
    "* **Concatenation:** Merges the outputs (`cnn_flat`, `att_flat`, `lstm_out`) into a single vector.\n",
    "* **Model Creation:** Instantiates a new Keras `Model` (`self.extraction_model`) where the input matches the original model, but the output is this concatenated feature vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Feature Extraction (`extract_and_save_features`)**\n",
    "This method executes the extraction on a dataset and saves the results.\n",
    "* **Sampling:** Allows extracting features from a subset of the data (e.g., 200 random samples) to reduce computational load for visualization, or processing the entire dataset. It handles random seeding for reproducibility.\n",
    "* **Batch Processing:** Iterates through the data in batches to manage memory usage efficiently.\n",

    "### Comprehensive Visualization and Analysis Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "This section introduces advanced visualization functions designed to produce high-quality, publication-ready figures for analyzing model performance and feature separability. These functions are optimized for creating clear, informative plots suitable for posters and presentations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Feature Separability Analysis (`analyze_feature_separability`)\n",
    "This function visualizes how well the model's learned features separate the two classes (Healthy vs. Parkinson's) using three dimensionality reduction techniques. It is optimized for large displays (XL/Poster version).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:**\n",
    "    * **PCA (Principal Component Analysis):** Projects features onto the two principal components that capture the most variance.\n",
    "    * **LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis):** Projects features onto a single axis that maximizes class separation. The results are plotted as **density curves (KDE)** to show the distribution overlap.\n",
    "    * **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding):** Visualizes high-dimensional clusters in 2D. A subset of samples (up to 1000) is used for efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Quantitative Metric (d-prime):**\n",
    "    * Calculates the **d-prime** sensitivity index based on the LDA projection.\n",
    "    * **Interpretation:** A higher d-prime indicates better separability between the healthy and pathological distributions. This value is annotated directly on the LDA plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visualization Details:**\n",
    "    * Generates a side-by-side subplot of PCA, LDA, and t-SNE.\n",
    "    * Uses distinct colors (Blue for Healthy, Red for Parkinson's) and large fonts for readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Side-by-Side Confusion Matrix & ROC (`plot_cm_and_roc_side_by_side`)\n",
    "This function creates a unified figure combining the two most critical binary classification metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Confusion Matrix (Left Panel):**\n",
    "    * Displays raw counts and percentages for True Negatives, False Positives, False Negatives, and True Positives.\n",
    "    * Annotates the axes with calculated **Specificity** and **Sensitivity (Recall)** scores.\n",
    "    * Uses a heatmap with large annotations for clear visibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **ROC Curve (Right Panel):**\n",
    "    * Plots the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve.\n",
    "    * Displays the **AUC (Area Under the Curve)** score in the legend.\n",
    "    * Includes a diagonal reference line (random guess) for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Full 3-Panel Evaluation (`plot_full_evaluation_square`)\n",
    "This comprehensive function generates a single figure containing three key evaluation plots, maintaining a square aspect ratio for better visual balance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Panel 1: Confusion Matrix:** Same enhanced heatmap as above.\n",
    "* **Panel 2: ROC Curve:** Standard ROC plot with AUC.\n",
    "* **Panel 3: Training History:**\n",
    "    * Plots **Loss** (Training vs. Validation) on the primary y-axis (red).\n",
    "    * Plots **AUC** (Training vs. Validation) on the secondary y-axis (blue).\n",
    "    * This allows for simultaneous monitoring of convergence and overfitting (e.g., if validation loss starts rising while training loss falls).\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions automatically save the generated high-resolution (300 DPI) images to the specified output directory."

    "### Model Explainability: Interpreting Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "To move beyond \"black box\" predictions, this module implements techniques to visualize *what* the model is looking at. It specifically helps diagnose issues like \"tunnel vision\" (where a model might over-focus on a recording artifact rather than the voice itself).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Feature Map Layout (`generate_feature_map_info`)\n",
    "Since the input to the model is a concatenated matrix of different features (e.g., Mel Spectrogram rows 0-29, MFCC rows 30-59), we need a \"map\" to interpret the results.\n",
    "* **Introspection:** It loads the original `.npz` feature file and inspects the shapes of the arrays inside.\n",
    "* **Layout Generation:** It dynamically creates a color-coded mask that maps specific rows of the input matrix back to their feature names (e.g., \"Rows 0-30 are Mel Spectrogram\").\n",
    "* **Visualization:** This allows us to overlay a legend on our heatmaps, clearly showing which biological feature corresponds to a high-attention region.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Grad-CAM Analysis (`run_gradcam_analysis`)\n",
    "This function performs **Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping** to visualize the spatial attention of the CNN branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Backpropagation Logic:**\n",
    "    1.  It selects a random subset of **True Positive (Parkinson's)** and **True Negative (Healthy)** samples.\n",
    "    2.  For each sample, it computes the gradient of the predicted class score with respect to the feature maps of the *last convolutional layer* (`conv2b`).\n",
    "    3.  These gradients act as weights: high gradients mean that specific region was crucial for the decision.\n",
    "    4.  The weighted feature maps are summed to create a coarse \"heatmap.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Upscaling:** The coarse heatmap (from the deep, pooled layer) is resized back to the original input dimensions (`194 x 60`) so it can be overlaid on the input features.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Visualization (The 3-Panel Plot):**\n",
    "    * **Panel 1 (PD Attention):** Average heatmap for Parkinson's patients. Hot spots (red) show where the model looks to find disease indicators.\n",
    "    * **Panel 2 (Healthy Attention):** Average heatmap for healthy controls.\n",
    "    * **Panel 3 (Feature Map):** The color-coded legend generated earlier, transposed to match the orientation of the heatmaps (Time on Y-axis, Features on X-axis).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters:** If the \"PD Attention\" map shows a distinct vertical line at the very start of the audio, it proves the model is suffering from the \"tunnel vision\" artifact described in the thesis."

    "### SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) Analysis Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "This function (`run_full_shap_analysis`) is the core of the explainability module. It leverages SHAP to explain *why* the model makes specific predictions by assigning an importance value to every input feature (time-frequency bin).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Configuration & Feature Mapping\n",
    "* **Feature Layout:** Before running SHAP, the function calls `generate_feature_map_info` (assumed to be defined elsewhere) to understand the structure of the input data (e.g., which rows correspond to Mel Spectrograms vs. MFCCs). This allows for human-readable labels later.\n",
    "* **Helper Function `feature_name_for_row`:** Maps a numerical row index (e.g., row 15) to its feature name (e.g., \"Mel Spectrogram\").\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Balanced Sample Selection\n",
    "To ensure the explanation is not biased toward the majority class:\n",
    "* The function identifies indices for **Healthy Controls (HC)** and **Parkinson's (PD)** samples in the test set.\n",
    "* It randomly selects a balanced number of samples (default `samples_per_class=50`) from each group.\n",
    "* These samples are concatenated and shuffled to form the `test_samples` batch for explanation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. SHAP Value Calculation\n",
    "* **Explainer:** Uses `shap.GradientExplainer`, which is efficient for deep learning models. It requires a background dataset (`X_train[:50]`) to serve as a reference point for \"zero\" feature contribution.\n",
    "* **Computation:** Iterates through the `test_samples` batch, computing SHAP values for each sample. The result is a 3D array: `(n_samples, n_features, n_time_steps)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Visualization 1: Global Feature Importance (Bar Chart)\n",
    "* **Ranking:** The function calculates the mean absolute SHAP value for every feature across all samples. This identifies the most influential features globally.\n",
    "* **Plotting:** A bar chart displays the top 20 most important features. Labels are constructed dynamically (e.g., \"Mel Spectrogram T10\") to pinpoint exactly *what* and *when* the model is looking at.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Visualization 2: Local & Comparative Heatmaps\n",
    "The function generates detailed heatmaps to compare how the model views Healthy vs. Parkinson's samples.\n",
    "* **Average HC/PD Maps:** Computes the average SHAP values for all Healthy samples and all Parkinson's samples separately.\n",
    "* **Difference Map (PD - HC):** This is the most critical visualization. It subtracts the Healthy map from the Parkinson's map.\n",
    "    * **Red Regions:** Features that push the prediction *towards* Parkinson's.\n",
    "    * **Blue Regions:** Features that push the prediction *towards* Healthy.\n",
    "    * **Insight:** This map often reveals the specific biomarkers (e.g., tremors at specific frequencies) the model has learned.\n",
    "* **Transposed Display:** The plotting helper `plot_aligned_heatmap` swaps axes so that **Time** is on the Y-axis and **Features** are on the X-axis, matching standard spectrogram layouts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Combined Output\n",
    "Finally, a comprehensive figure is assembled:\n",
    "* **Left:** Global Feature Importance Bar Chart.\n",
    "* **Right:** A 2x2 grid containing the Average HC heatmap, Average PD heatmap, Difference heatmap, and a reference Feature Map legend.\n",
    "* **Statistical Significance (Optional):** If enough samples are available, a t-test is performed to generate a p-value map, highlighting which feature differences are statistically significant."

    "#### 1. Data Preparation\n",
    "* **Loading:** Reads the pre-processed feature matrix (`.npz`).\n",
    "* **Splitting:** Performs a **stratified train-test split (80/20)**. Stratification is crucial here to ensure that the ratio of Healthy to Parkinson's patients remains consistent in both sets, preventing bias.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Model Training\n",
    "* **Initialization:** Builds the hybrid `ParkinsonDetectorModel` based on the input shape.\n",
    "* **Compilation:** Configures the **Adam** optimizer (`lr=0.001`) and **Binary Cross-Entropy** loss. Tracks Accuracy and AUC.\n",
    "* **Fitting:** Trains for **30 epochs** with a batch size of 32. Uses the `checkpoint_cb` to save only the best model weights based on validation performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Feature Space Analysis\n",
    "To validate the model's learning capability, the script performs a \"Separability Analysis\" at two stages:\n",
    "1.  **Input Features:** Analyzes the raw data before processing. Usually shows high overlap between classes.\n",
    "2.  **Dense Layer Inputs:** Extracts the learned representations just before the final classification layer. This typically demonstrates how the model has clustered the classes, aiming for a high **d-prime** separation score.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Evaluation & Visualization\n",
    "* **Metrics:** Calculates predictions and saves raw probabilities to `evaluation.csv`.\n",
    "* **Plotting:** Generates a comprehensive square-aspect figure containing the Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve, and Training History (Loss/AUC curves) for a complete performance snapshot.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Explainability (XAI)\n",
    "Finally, the script loads the best saved model state to run computationally expensive interpretability checks:\n",
    "* **SHAP:** quantifies feature importance.\n",
    "* **Grad-CAM:** visualizes spatial attention maps."
